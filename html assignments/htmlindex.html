        <H3> BIOGRAPHY</H3>
        <p> hello , i am khadijat suleiman. I am currently enrolled in the Cloud Engineering Track at Alt school. 
            I have always been had an interest in technology and have delved into various areas before now. I recently found interest 
            in the Cloud and decided to take this course to build my skills. Asides tech, I am enjoy travelling, spending time with family and friends
            and scrolling though social media.
        </p>

        <h3> WHY I JOINED ALTSCHOOL</h3>
        <P>A friend of mine had gone through the program a year before and referred the program to me. 
            I joined because I wanted a well-structured program that provides the guidance required to develop the required skills
            for a cloud engineer. It's also an opportunity to build life long friendships with other people in the same field.
        </P>

        <h3> Goals</h3>
        <p> My goal is to graduate with the required skills to enable me pivot successfully to a Cloud engineering role.</p>
